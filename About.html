          Currently, I am a third-year university student studying a bachelor’s in computer and 
          information sciences at IIE MSA Ruimsig in South Africa. Without a doubt, my best skill 
          is being able to understand and execute new concepts and design and implement them. 
          <br><br>
          I have prior experience with creating websites since I created a website on a website editor 
          for a media company. Additionally, I am currently the head web developer in our team for our 
          third-year project at the university. This project includes a website with a content management system.
          <br><br>
          Additionally, I have some experience working in C#, java, and even Delphi. At the moment I have 5 years 
          of programming experience this was from high school where I learned Delphi and Microsoft access and at  
          university where I learned a few programming languages and concepts alongside learning how to use MySQL,  
          PhpMyAdmin, and MongoDB.
          <br><br>
          I mostly spend my time improving my programming skills and working. I love almost all types of programming 
          and what amazing and interesting projects can be made by only writing code.
          <br><br>
          I work extremely well with others, and I consider myself a team player whom anyone on my team can come to 
          for help even if it is after my working hours. This has been improved by my third-year project, as a team 
          leader, I learned how to manage my team and assign jobs according to the team members’ skills.
