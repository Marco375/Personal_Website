          Currently, I am a third-year university student, studying for a Bachelor’s degree in computer and information 
          sciences at IIE MSA Ruimsig in South Africa. Without a doubt, my best skill is being able to understand and 
          execute new concepts, then design and implement them. 
          <br><br>
          I have prior experience with creating websites, since I had to create a website on a website editor for a 
          media company. Additionally, I am currently the head web developer in our team for our third-year project 
          at the university. This project includes a website with a content management system.
          <br><br>
          I also have some experience working in C#, Java, and even Delphi. At the moment I have 5 years of programming 
          experience. This includes high school, where I was taught Delphi and Microsoft access. At University, I was 
          taught a few programming languages and concepts, alongside learning how to use MySQL, PhpMyAdmin, and MongoDB.
          <br><br>
          I mostly spend my time improving my programming skills and working. I love almost all types of programming and 
          I am fascinated by what amazing and interesting projects can be made by only writing code.
          <br><br>
          I work extremely well with others, and I consider myself a team player whom anyone on my team can come to for
           help, even if it is after my working hours. This skill has been improved by my third-year project, where as 
           Team leader, I have learned how to manage my team and assign jobs according to the team members’ skills and 
           strengths.
