        Currently I am a third year university student studying a bachelors in computer and information sciences
        at IIE MSA Ruimsig in South Africa. Without a doubt my best skill is to be able to understand and execute new 
        concepts and design and impelement them. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I am experienced in creating websites either form scratch of by using a website editor such as wix
        If a client can tell me what they want their website to feel like and what their businnes provides its clients
        I can create it from coding to html, css, javascript, sql and php to deciding on wich color schemes will work the best
        with certain layouts and images.
        <br>
        <br>
        Additionally I have some experience with working in C#, java and even Delphi. Ath the moment I have 5 years of programming 
        experience this was from highg school where i learned Delphi and Microsoft access and University where i learned a few 
        programming languages and concepts alognside learning how to use MySql, PHPmyadmin, oracle and MongoDB 
        <br>
        <br>
        My knowledge is also not limited to the things I learned at university and school I have expanded my and experience
        by working with a media company and designing their website on Wix and by trying out and learning a few new concepts 
        such as sending an email from a C# application and how to design a website that is both visually apealing and responsive. I will always try to 
        grow and improve myself to be able to help my clients achieve their dream
        <br>
        <br>
        I work extremely well with others and I consider myself a team player who anyone of my team can come to for help
        even if it is after my working hours.
