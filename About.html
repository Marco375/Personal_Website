          Currently I am a third year university student studying a bachelors in computer and information sciences
          at IIE MSA Ruimsig in South Africa. Without a doubt my best skill is to be able to understand and execute new 
          concepts and design and impelement them. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I have prior experience with creating websites since I created a website on a website editor for a mediia company.
          Additionally, I am currently the head web developer in our team for our third year project at university. 
          This project includes a website with a content management system.
          <br>
          <br>
          Additionally I have some experience with working in C#, java and even Delphi. Ath the moment I have 5 years of programming 
          experience this was from highg school where I learned Delphi and Microsoft access and University where i learned a few 
          programming languages and concepts alognside learning how to use MySql, PHPmyadmin and MongoDB.
          <br>
          <br>
          I mostly spend my time on improving my programming skills and working. I love almost all types of programming 
          and what amazing and interesting projects can be made by only writing code.
          <br>
          <br>
          I work extremely well with others and I consider myself a team player who anyone of my team can come to for help
          even if it is after my working hours. This has been improved by my third year project, as a team leader I learned how to
          manage my team and assing jobs accoring to the team members skills.
