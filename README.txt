This website will be used to show my programming skills and will document my journey toward becoming a full-stack developer 
Currently, the website only works for desktop devices, and I am very limited by GitHub in what I can create with my website. 
GitHub does not allow me to execute server-side code. This means the website will be very limited in its uses. For example,
I cannot create a contact form that sends the userâ€™s information via email to my email. In the future, I will move my site from 
GitHub pages to a website hosting platform.
